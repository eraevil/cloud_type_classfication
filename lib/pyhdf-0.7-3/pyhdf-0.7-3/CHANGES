List of changes to 'pyhdf' since the initial release.

pyhdf 0.7-3
-----------
  July 13 2005
    Interim release.
      - The main motivation for this release is to benefit from HDF-4.2r1 bug fixes and 
        optionally the SZIP compression method allowed by HDF4.2 on SDS datasets.
      - To use this release, you need to install HDF4.2r1. It will *NOT* work over
        HDF4.1. To compress datasets using SZIP, szip 2.0 library must also be installed,
        and your HDF installation must have been compiled with the szip option enabled.
      - Conversely, pyhdf versions preceeding 0.7-3 will *NOT* work over HDF4.2. 
        Only pyhdf-0.7-3 will work with HDF4.2.
      - Added new compression type SDC.COMP_SZIP, and defined new constants SDC.COMP_SZIP_EC
        and SDC.COMP_SZIP_NN to configure the behavior of SZIP.
      - Updated methods SDS.sdsetcompress() and SDS.getcompress() to allow compression using 
        SZIP compression, and inquire about SZIP compression configuration.
      - All classes are now of "new-style" type (eg they derive from calss 'object').
      - Updated documentation.

pyhdf-0.7-2
-----------
  June 9 2004
    Bug fix release.
    - Do not strip trailing NULL at end of string attributes.
    - Single-valued attributes were incorrectly processed in the set()
      method of the SDAttr class.
    - The following feature was not correctly documented.
      When attributes are accessed using the "dot" notation, it is important
      to be able to differentiate between true python attributes and 
      HDF attributes. For ex., if 'sds' is an HDF SD instance and one writes
      'sds.x = "abcd" ', should attribute 'x' be considered as an HDF attribute and
      its value written in the HDF file, or as a python attribute and stored in the
      'sds' object dictionnary ?

      To solve that problem, an attribute is considered a python attribute if it
      starts with an '_', and as an HDF attribute otherwise. Note that this only
      applies when using the "dot" notation (or the getattr()/setattr() equivalent
      functions). If one needs to define an HDF attribute whose name starts with a
      '_' (eg: '_FillValue'), allocate an SDAttr instance and use its get()/set()
      methods.

      Ex.:
        sds = SD('myfile.hdf').select('mydataset')
        sds._FillValue = -999   # wrong: _FillValue not stored in the HDF dataset
        sds.attr('_FillValue').set(SDC.FLOAT32, -999.0) # good!

pyhdf-0.7-1
-----------
  December 16 2003
    - Implementation of the V (vgroup) API.

pyhdf-0.6-1
-----------
  December 3 2003
    -Implementation of the VS (vdata) API.
    -Added support for unsigned integer types UINT16 and UINT32 inside
     the SD API. Version 22 of Numeric must however be installed
     (see comments inside `setup.py' for a way to remove support for
     unsigned integers and compile with a lower version number of Numeric).
    -Improved documentation.
    -Bug fixes (thanks to Richard.Andrews@esands.com)

pyhdf-0.5-2
-----------
  August 3 2003
    -After starting the implementation of another HDF API, it
     was found that the idea of having on C extension module
     per HDF API was not a good one. It made difficult the sharing
     of HDF data structures between the C extension modules.
     It was thus decided to have just one C extension module
     shared between all the python modules.
    -The new C extension module is named "_hdfext". The SD python 
     module has been modified to import "_hdfext" instead of "_sdext".
    -A new "error" module has been added.

pyhdf-0.5-1
-----------
  July 31 2003
    -Initial release.
