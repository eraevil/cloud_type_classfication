Description: The pyhdf package wraps the functionality
        of the NCSA HDF version 4 library inside a Python OOP
        framework. The SD (scientific dataset), VS
        (Vdata) and V (Vgroup) APIs are currently implemented.
        Other APIs should be covered in the
        near future. SD datasets are read/written
        through Numeric arrays. netCDF files can also
        be read and modified with pyhdf.
